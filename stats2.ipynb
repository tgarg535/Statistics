        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "A **random variable** is a numerical outcome of a random experiment or process. It assigns a real number to each possible outcome in the sample space. Random variables can be either **discrete** (taking distinct values) or **continuous** (taking any value in a continuous range).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The two main types of random variables are:\n",
        "1. **Discrete Random Variable**: Takes finite or countable values (e.g., number of heads in a coin toss).\n",

        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "A **Probability Distribution Function (PDF)** is a function that describes the likelihood of each possible outcome of a random variable. For continuous random variables, it gives the probability that the variable falls within a particular range.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The **Binomial Distribution** describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is used to model scenarios with two outcomes, like success/failure or yes/no, and is defined by the number of trials \\( n \\) and the probability of success \\( p \\).\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The **Poisson Distribution** models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It is often used to describe rare events, like the number of phone calls received by a call center in an hour or the number of accidents in a day.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "A **Continuous Uniform Distribution** is a probability distribution where all intervals of the same length within a given range are equally likely. For example, if a random variable can take any value between 0 and 1, all values in this interval are equally likely.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The **Standard Normal Distribution** is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is important because it allows for standardized comparisons of different normal distributions, and Z-scores are calculated using this distribution.\n",

        "### **13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that, for a large enough sample size, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution. This is critical because it allows for the use of normal distribution methods in hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The CLT ensures that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean becomes normal, even if the original data is not normally distributed. This is why the normal distribution is often used in inferential statistics.\n",

        "### **15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "**Z statistics** are used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean. It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from the sample mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the population.\n",

        "### **16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?**\n",

        "Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
        "\\]\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "- **Point Estimate**: A single value estimate for a population parameter, such as the sample mean as an estimate for the population mean.\n",
        "- **Interval Estimate**: A range of values used to estimate a population parameter, commonly represented by confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",

        "### **18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "A **Confidence Interval** provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall. It is important because it quantifies the uncertainty in the estimate and helps with decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The **Z-score** is used to calculate the **confidence interval** by determining the number of standard deviations from the mean. For example, a 95% confidence interval corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "**Z-scores** standardize data from different distributions, allowing comparisons of values from different datasets on a common scale. This helps in comparing values even when the distributions have different means and standard deviations.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "The main assumptions are:\n",
        "1. The sample size must be sufficiently large (typically \\( n > 30 \\)).\n",
        "2. The samples must be independent.\n",
        "3. The population should have a finite variance.\n",
